== Introduction
makerManager is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing prints and other machine jobs in a makerspace. More importantly, makerManager is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, makerManager can get your print and machine management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!
